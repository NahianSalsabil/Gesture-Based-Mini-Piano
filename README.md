# Gesture-Based-Mini-Piano
## CSE316 Microcontroller and Microprocessor Term Project
We have made a mini version of piano using the ATmega32 Microcontroller which is able to play different musical notes. We've been a bit ambitious here by making this piano play according to the finger gestures made by the users. Also the users can record and save the tune they play and playback it anytime they want.

The detailed proposal of the project can be found at `Project Proposal\project proposal.pptx`

The simulation file can be found at `Simulation\mini_piano.pdsprj`

The codes can be found at `Code\` with relevant libraries.

Here is the demonstration video of our project
